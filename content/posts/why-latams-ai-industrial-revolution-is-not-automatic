diffusion is uneven and not automatic outside the core

diffusion is stalled in the absence of a low-cost input

(Perez book)

"A technological revolution can be defined as a powerful and highly visible cluster of new and dynamic technologies, products and industries, capable of bringing about an upheaval in the whole fabric of the economy and of propelling a long-term upsurge of development. This is a strongly interrelated constellation of technical innovations, generally including an important, all-pervasive low-cost input (often a source of energy, sometimes a crucial material), significant new products and processes, a new infrastructure. The latter usually changes the front-ending speed and reliability of transmutation and communications, while drastically reducing their cost."

"Diffusion ((of a technological revolution)) is stalled in the absence of a low-cost input. "



(Perez 1983 paper)

"So each technological revolution brings at the same time a set of new industries, with a low cost input at the core, and a set of generic all-pervasive technologies and organizational principles capable of renewing all the other productive activities."


"The deployment of information technology propels and is propelled by vast telecommunications sytems, which must be **reliable, low cost, powerful and of high capacity and flexibility**. Without that, diffusion is stalled."

Each set of technologies undergoes a difficult and prolonged period of stretching when the impending exhaustion of its potential becomes increasingly visible.
This phenomenon is crucial to the present interpretation. When each technological revolution irrupts, the logic and the effects of its predecessor are still fully dominant and exert a powerful resistance. The generalized shift into 'the logic of the new' requires two or three turbulent decades of transition from one to the other, when the successful installation of new superior capacities accentuates the decline of the old. By the time the process has fully taken place, the end of the previous revolution is little more than a whimper. 



The technological breakthroughs of a technological revolution spread far beyond the confines of the industries and sectors where they originally developed. Each provides a set of interrelated generic technologies and organizational principles that allow and foster a quantum jump in potential productivity for practically all economic activities. This leads each time to the modernization and regeneration of the whole productive system so that the level of efficiency rises to a new height every 50 years or so (figure 2.1). 

The appearance of a new techno-economic paradigm affects behaviors related to innovation and investment in a way that could be compared to a gold rush Or the discovery of vast new territory: It is the opening of a wide design, product and profit space that gradually fires the imagination of engineers, entrepreneurs, and investors who in their trial and error experiments applying the new wealth-creating potential generate successful practices and behaviors that gradually find the new best-practice frontier. 


The logic of the paradigm reaches well beyond the economic sphere to become the general and shared organisational common sense of the period. It could then be called an organisational paradigm. Eventually, the social institutional framework that will accommodate and enable the full deployment of that technological revolution will follow those basic principles. Thus, the mental maps for efficiency guiding both economic and non-economic activities will be congruent. 

w
It's important to note that the techno-economic paradigm serves both as a propeller of diffusion and as a delaying force. It's a propeller because it provides a model that can be followed by all, but its configuration takes time, about a decade or more after Big Bang, and given that each revolution is by definition different from the previous one, the new principles will have to be socially learned. But this learning must overshadow the forces of inertia that stem from the success of the previous paradigm. Its prevalence is the main obstacle for the diffusion of the next revolution. 

The commonly held view of constant progress through linear and cumulative development is as inadequate as the idea that technological change is continuous and random. Both processes can, of course, be seen as regularly increasing by putting the accent on the long-term trends and ignoring the many minor or major variations. 

!!!!!!! A great surge of development is defined here as the process by which a technological revolution and its paradigm propagate across the economy, leading to structural changes in production, distribution, communication, and consumption, as well as to profound and qualitative changes in society.
The process evolves from small beginnings in restricted sectors and geographic regions and then to encompassing the bulk of activities in the core country or countries. And diffusing out towards further and further peripheries depending on the capacity of the transport and communication infrastructures. !!!!

In addition, a technological revolution through the paradigm that takes shape in its wake sets a new higher level for the average productivity and quality that can be achieved across the board. The great surge of development which results from the full social assimilation of its potential ends up pulling the whole group of core economies involved onto that higher productivity plateau. 

The changes in direction that come from a technological revolution can be dangerous periods for new comers. A paradigm shift opens the necessary windows of opportunity for forging ahead and catching up. While the front-runners are also learning. 


Societies are profoundly shaken and shaped by each technological revolution. In turn, the technological potential is shaped and steered as a result of intense social, political, and ideological confrontations and compromises. 

These difficult, long-term processes of transformation are in the nature of the capitalist system and involve intense interactions between the economy and social institutions as well as profound changes in both. Each technological revolution is received as a shock, and its diffusion encounters powerful resistance both in the established institutions and in the people themselves. Hence, the full unfolding of its wealth-creating potential at first has rather chaotic and Contradictory social effects. It later will demand a significant institutional recomposition. This will include changes in the regulatory framework affecting all markets and economic activities, as well as the redesign of a whole range of institutions from government through financial regulation to education, as well as modifications in social behaviors and ideas just thanks to the restructuring of the context to fit the potential of the revolution that golden ages can afford.
